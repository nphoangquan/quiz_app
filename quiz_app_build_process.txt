    -   Profile/Dashboard Screen

5. Firebase Database Structure (Example - Firestore)

-   Users Collection

        {
          "uid": "user123",
          "name": "John Doe",
          "email": "john@example.com",
          "createdAt": "timestamp"
        }

-   Quizzes Collection

        {
          "quizId": "quiz123",
          "title": "Math Quiz",
          "description": "Basic Algebra",
          "ownerId": "user123",
          "createdAt": "timestamp",
          "isPublic": true
        }

-   Questions Subcollection

        {
          "questionId": "q1",
          "question": "2+2=?",
          "options": ["2","3","4","5"],
          "answerIndex": 2
        }

-   Results Collection

        {
          "resultId": "res123",
          "userId": "user123",
          "quizId": "quiz123",
          "score": 8,
          "createdAt": "timestamp"
        }

6. Implementation Steps

1.  Set up project and Firebase connection.
2.  Implement Authentication (login, signup, logout).
3.  Create Firestore models (User, Quiz, Question, Result).
4.  Build UI for Login/Register, Home, Quiz Details.
5.  Implement quiz creation and storage in Firestore.
6.  Implement quiz participation and scoring logic.
7.  Build flashcard and practice modes.
8.  Create user profile dashboard with statistics.
9.  Add optional features (sharing, collaborative editing).
10. Optimize performance and test.

7. Deployment

-   Use Firebase Hosting for web build (flutter web).
-   Build APK/IPA for Android and iOS release.
-   Setup CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Codemagic.

8. Future Improvements

-   AI-based quiz generation from text.
-   Offline mode with local database (sqflite).
-   Push notifications (Firebase Messaging).
-   Monetization: Ads or subscription plans.
